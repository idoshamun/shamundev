title: Svelte Through the Eyes of a React Developer
---

Throughout my career, I've used various frameworks like Polymer (web components), Angular, Vue, and React. Recently I started using Svelte for a side-project. This experience brought a mix of nostalgia and new challenges, reminding me of the classic simplicity of web development while introducing modern capabilities.

Initially, transitioning from JSX to Svelte was like stepping into a familiar yet distinct world. React's approach of blending HTML, CSS, and JavaScript felt cluttered at first, but its inherent flexibility and power eventually won me over. Svelte, however, offers a clear separation of concerns within a file, dividing it into script, style, and DOM sections. This separation feels reminiscent of traditional web development but is enhanced with a simple templating language for efficient handling of loops, conditions, and more.

Adapting to Svelte's syntax, especially coming from a JSX background, takes some time. JSX, essentially JavaScript, eventually felt intuitive. When writing Svelte components, you ask yourself more than once how to handle trivial scenarios, for example, how should I handle promises. With that said, I find the shift to simpler templating lannguage encourages cleaner, more organized code but requires a new approach.

The contrast in community size between React and Svelte is significant. React and Angular, backed by tech giants, have vast community support and resources. Svelte's smaller community can be limiting when seeking solutions or third-party packages. However, the comprehensive documentation of Svelte and SvelteKit largely compensates for this, providing a robust foundation for learning and problem-solving.

SvelteKit, as a full-stack solution, is a notable advantage of Svelte. It integrates seamlessly with Svelte, offering a clear path for building comprehensive applications and simplifying decision-making for developers. This contrasts with the React ecosystem, where the plethora of choices for complementary frameworks can lead to decision paralysis.

Svelte's reactive system, while powerful, is very implicit, many operations happen behind the scenes, leading to a less predictable experience compared to React's hooks. Additionally, TypeScript integration in Svelte feels less native than in JSX, though it is improving.

SvelteKit shines with its simplicity and flexibility, supporting various rendering strategies and offering out-of-the-box layout support, which streamlines the development process. This ease of use is a significant draw for developers looking for an efficient yet versatile framework.

In conclusion, as I continue to explore Svelte in a side project, my views are subject to change. While I haven't decided if Svelte will be my go-to for future projects, its unique approach and SvelteKit's capabilities make it an intriguing option worth further exploration. Svelte offers a refreshing take on web development, combining classic structure with modern features. Its learning curve, distinct syntax, and community size are important considerations, but its integration with SvelteKit and straightforward yet flexible approach make it a compelling choice for developers seeking to diversify their framework repertoire.
